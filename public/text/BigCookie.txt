I actually have no clue when we made this. It’s just a big ass heart cookie the size of my love for you. I just know we were making cookies, you did an amazing job, and I “added creativity”. I remember us bringing the cookies somewhere to share, but I can’t remember where. We haven’t had many baking dates (mostly because I’m a liability in the kitchen) but I’ve had fun every time. Most of the times we bake it turns out slightly disastrous. Like the peppermint brownies. They always slap tho.
