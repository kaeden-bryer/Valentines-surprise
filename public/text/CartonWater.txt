The day that began it all. This is the day I asked you to hang out with me on Valentine’s, knowing that our relationship would never be the same again. I took a gamble with huge risk and reward, and it paid off tremendously. I stayed inside the Kroger strip mall for so long, the smallest touch sending dopamine shuttling through our bodies. I’m so glad you said yes–even though you didn’t know what you were getting yourself into.
