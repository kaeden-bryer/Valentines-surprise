I lied–this was my favorite memory from the Arctic Monkeys concert. Making out VORACIOUSLY in the car after the concert. Reality hit so hard when we stopped making out and realized the damage we’d done. It was kinda embarrassing going into the 7/11 looking the way we did, but now I remember it fondly. And that mango milk was absolutely worth whatever opinions the people in there might’ve had of us.
