This is from that time we visited Chris after ZooBoo! I remember I was going to take off my floof, but you asked me to keep it on so you would feel less weird. Looking back, that was so reminiscent of the time we went to A&W after ZooBoo the year before. I wish I had a picture from that day too, but I don’t. Even though Chris doesn’t work there, I would love to go back sometime for those Quesadillas. I think I just like going to restaurants with you. I always have a good time when we get food together.
