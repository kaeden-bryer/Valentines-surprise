We’ve inscribed our names in ephemeral mediums so many times. It’s as if the symbol of it only stays alive if we continue to write it again and again. But I like that–because if that’s true, we do a great job. Whether it’s in sand, snow or wood, we’ve declared our love to the Earth so many times. Romance aside, I wanted to include this memory because I had fun taking the risk to walk on the lake together. It didn’t last long, but I’ll never forget it.
