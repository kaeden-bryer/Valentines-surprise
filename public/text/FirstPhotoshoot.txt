This is the first real photoshoot we ever had. I was giddy from having you over officially as my girlfriend, and I remember looking back at these pictures all the time early on in our relationship. Look at how genuinely happy we are here–I’m so glad I decided to ask you out. Damn, even thinking about it again is making me smile as I write this. Asking you out is the best decision I ever made.
