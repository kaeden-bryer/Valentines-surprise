I feel like this was around the start of your crafts/at-home beauty guru chapter. You wanted to try painting jeans, and I wanted to spend time with you. It was a beautiful day, and the Arabic family sitting a couple tables down gave us free food. When we eventually live together comfortably, I hope we spend many days like this together.
