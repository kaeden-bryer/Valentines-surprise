The first time we ever cooked a meal together! And honestly, it might’ve been the best meal we’ve ever made too. Dancing in the kitchen with you in the empty kitchen, I felt myself whisked away to an alternate reality where we’d been living together for years yet the joy had never worn off. I was drinking in the image of you heavily that day. The image of the person I wanted to stay with me forever.
