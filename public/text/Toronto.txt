Our trip up to Toronto! We didn’t even have to go that far to see Hiatus Kaiyote, but we went anyways and I’m so glad we did. Walking around cities is one of my favorite things to do, and I’m glad I got to do so with you. We should travel to more places for short trips like this! We’ll need a little more money first (or get comfortable with less in our accounts), but I’ll happily wait until you’re ready.
