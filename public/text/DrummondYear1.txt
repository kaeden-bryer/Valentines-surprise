It’s hard to cover everything that happened the first year I went to Drummond with you. I just know our relationship before and after going was very, very different. There’s obviously things like the grand reveal and that Friday on the playground, but also there was the ride back and the first time we marked each other's bodies on the train tracks in Clare. I’m glad you let me become a part of this aspect of your life you treasure deeply, and I’m glad I get to treasure it just as you do.
