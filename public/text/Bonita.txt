Our first born child :) I think she was born April 1st 2023 (please forgive me for not remembering). It’s funny–you always said you want your child to have an April birthday. Well, here you are. She’s our first and our favorite. I hope when we actually become parents though, we don’t have favorites. She’s really been through it all huh?
