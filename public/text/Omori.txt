The first game we ever played togetherðŸ¥¹. The days when we would sit in the back of the Brodyssey at Ford Field and play Omori while enjoying each othersâ€™ prescenses. Since then, weâ€™ve played Hollow Knight, Neva, and a little bit of Untitled Goose Game. But I think it might be time to play another one soonâ€¦ maybe Little Nightmares 3?
