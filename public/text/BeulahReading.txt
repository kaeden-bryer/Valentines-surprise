This trip felt like a pocket dimension isolated from everything else. We did so much, and looking back at our dumps on instagram, we were really living life to the fullest. In a perfect world, we would just continue to live that way forever and ever and ever. We had so many photo shoots up there–we should really bring that back. If you’re reading this, that means you’ve gotten your polaroid camera. Time to get to work :)
