Was this our first official date? Weâ€™d continued to hang out after getting together, but we never really planned dates. I think this mightâ€™ve been the first instance I planned an entire day for us together. We both look so young in this picture, itâ€™s so adorableðŸ¥¹. Do you remember sitting by the stingrays and just talking for what mustâ€™ve been half an hour? Or hanging out in the shark tunnel? I think this was in May, but I could be getting that wildly wrong.
