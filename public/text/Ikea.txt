Slide day. I was so incredibly close to asking you out this day, and I wish I had the guts to. The romantic tension was through the roof, and we stayed outside at the playground for so long. And you know how much I hate the cold. Unrelated, I can’t wait until we finally go IKEA shopping for our first apartment or house together. It’s gonna feel so full circle :)
