“Yo take a picture of me like I’m not looking” LMAO. This is the day we were so suspiciously dating and EVERYONE in our friend group knew it. Do you remember taking pictures in the 7/11 mirror together after dinner? I’m almost tempted to say at this point we’d already started dating, but you can tell by my hair that it’s not even close yet…
