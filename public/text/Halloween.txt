We were so hot this Halloween, I just know everyone was jealous. Even though based on personality everyone says I should’ve been the angel, you just looked straight out of heaven. I can’t believe the Theta party got shut down by the police. We both got pretty messed up that night–probably should hold back a little more in the future haha
