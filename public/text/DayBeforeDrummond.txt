When The Neighborhood was the hottest music that existed. This day is so important, because it’s the day we finally said “I love you” to each other. We’d been holding it back for so long–it was practically brimming from my lips. Then, we proceeded to make out long and furiously in celebration of our admission of true love for one another. I don’t think I’ve ever missed you more than the day after.
