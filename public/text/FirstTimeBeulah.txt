It’s hard to tell from just this picture, but this is the first time we went up to Beulah. It’s hard to believe that happened less than a year ago. I think it’s so cute that we write our initials in a heart every time there’s sand or snow. A lot happened on this trip. Holy shit, we were wild and young.
