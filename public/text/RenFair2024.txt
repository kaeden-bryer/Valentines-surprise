This almost looks like a scene from a movie. I can see it nowâ€“the foreigner travelling with his mercenary group through town sweeps the town jewel off her feet (literally) and whisks her away in a grand escape from both of their lives. They elope, escaping both of their past lives and starting anew, facing the uncertainty together.
