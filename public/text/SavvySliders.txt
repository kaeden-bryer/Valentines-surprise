I’m tempted to call this our first date, because this is the day I realized I wouldn’t ever get bored spending time with you. What originally started as a short lunch to Captain Jay’s turned into this elaborate journey, going from place to place with no destination in mind, but having fun at every corner. This is also one of the first times we hung out one on one together, and I wasn’t sure if we’d have things to talk about all day. I couldn’t have been more wrong. I really want to go to Savvy Sliders again, and get some tribute burgers to our past selves.
