The Crumbl cookie we got! It was so sweet and so yummy, and we really needed it after all the Chinese filming we did. Now that everything’s said and done, I’m really glad we decided to make that film. Even though both of us EASILY would’ve passed with an A if we went an easier route, it was fun to make and an integral memory now. From the time we took a Chinese class together.
