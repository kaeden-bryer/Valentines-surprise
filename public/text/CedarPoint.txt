Baby’s first time going to CedarPoint!! We went on such a good day and got so many rides in. Luke’s an absolute GOAT for going with us too. We were spoiled really hard–when we went again for your 20th birthday, the lines felt excruciatingly long. Also, that chipotle on the way home slapped like nothing else.
