BABY IS 20!! I don’t know about you, but I felt so fancy eating at that pasta place together. It felt appropriate–we were finally both 20 years old, the dawn of the rest of our future together. The next couple of years, things around us are going to change rapidly. We’ll both start getting real jobs, you’ll move on to dental school, we’ll move into an apartment together, we’ll get married and our life together will truly begin. 20 is that fine-line dividing a teenage dream and a committed relationship with each other. I hope you’re as excited as I am.
