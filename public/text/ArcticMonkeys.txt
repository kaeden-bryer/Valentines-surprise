THIS CONCERT WAS SO FUN. My favorite part was when I carried you back to the car on my back and people were cheering us on. Even though we’d been to M83 and Plini before this, I think this was when I really got hooked on concerts. I think this is still my favorite concert we’ve attended, and one of my favorite memories with you. I think we also had our “first fight” this day too at Great Lakes in the furniture shop.
