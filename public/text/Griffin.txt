The tensions and atmosphere were immaculate on this day. Incredibly, this was a whole 5 months before I officially asked you out. I can’t believe you would’ve said yes if I asked this day… I wonder how our relationship would’ve changed if I did. Even though I would’ve liked to date you sooner, I also think the slow burn made our relationship more meaningful. But this really was the perfect backdrop to ask a person out wasn’t it?
