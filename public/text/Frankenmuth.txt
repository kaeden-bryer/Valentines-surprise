This was such a monumental trip for both of us for reasons I don’t need to say aloud. The holiday fervor of Frankenmuth really was the best backdrop for us to stay at the Drury together. Our first escape to a faraway town, less than 2 hours away from home. I wish we could’ve stayed longer, but it seems the only solution is to go back.
