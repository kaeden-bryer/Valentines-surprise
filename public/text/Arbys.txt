Our first official date. And it was at a f**kin Arby’s. Honestly, I don’t think our first date could’ve been better at any other place. I remember having a wonderful time with you, and feeling butterflies taking pictures with you officially as my girlfriend. The beginning of the most serious unserious relationship. I think we even split the bill lol.
